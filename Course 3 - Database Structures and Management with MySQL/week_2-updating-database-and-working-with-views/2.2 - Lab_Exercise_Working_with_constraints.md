# Working with constraints 
 
MySQL Contraints are used to ensure that each value in a column cell is unique

## The Three main type of constrainys in MySQL Databse

- `Key constraints` : apply rules to key types 
- `Domain contraints`: use to govern the value for a specific column
- `Referential integrety contraints`: use to establish rules for referential keys


### Key constraints

- `Pk - The Primary Key Constraints`

### Domain contraints
- `Ã¬nt`, `varchar(255)`, etc 

### Referential integrety constraints

**Key constraints** 
In a Referential integrety constraints, there are two type of tables 
- referencing_table with `PK`and 
- referenced_table with `FK`
The value of the of the FK in the referenced_table must always exist in the referencing_table otherwise a connection can't be establis between the two 

- `ON DELETE CASCADE` option automatically deletes the related row in a table with FK
when the row is deleted from the main
- `ON DELETE C`S`ADE` 

```sql
CREATE DATABASE little_lemon_constraints;
use little_lemon_constraints 
```

```sql
-- Create Customers Table  with the specified constraints:
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE
);
```
**Explanation**:

- `CustomerID`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL. It serves as the primary key (PRIMARY KEY) for the table, ensuring each customer has a unique identifier.
- `FullName`: This column is defined as a variable character (VARCHAR) with a maximum length of 100 characters. It cannot be NULL, ensuring that each customer has a full name associated with their record.
- `PhoneNumber`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL. It is also marked as UNIQUE, ensuring that each phone number is associated with only one customer in the table.

```sql
CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    BookingID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    Booking DATE NOT NULL,
    TableNumber INT NOT NULL,
    NumberOfGuests INT NOT NULL CHECK (NumberOfGuests <= 8),
    CustomerID INT NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE
);
```
**Explanation**
- `BookingID`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL. It serves as the primary key (PRIMARY KEY) for the table, ensuring each booking has a unique identifier.
- `Booking`: This column is defined as a DATE type and cannot be NULL, representing the date of the booking.
- `TableNumber`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL, representing the number of the table booked.
- `NumberOfGuests`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL. It is constrained by a CHECK constraint to ensure that the number of guests is less than or equal to 8.
- `CustomerID`: This column is defined as an integer (INT) and cannot be NULL. It represents the ID of the customer who made the booking.
  
`FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE`: This line specifies a foreign key constraint that references the CustomerID column in the Customers table. It ensures referential integrity, meaning that a booking can only be associated with an existing customer. The ON DELETE CASCADE and ON UPDATE CASCADE options ensure that if the referenced customer is deleted or updated, the corresponding bookings will also be deleted or updated accordingly.



```sql
-- view all tables
show tables;

-- use show columns to see all constraints applied to a table
show columns from ex_table_name;

show columns from employee;
```

### Correct statements about constraints:

- Constraints can be declared when you create a table. (Correct)

- When creating a table, you can specify constraints such as primary key, foreign key, unique, and check constraints.
Constraints can be changed and modified within a table. (Correct)

- Constraints can be modified or dropped using ALTER TABLE statements.
Constraints can be deleted from a table. (Correct)

- Constraints can be dropped using ALTER TABLE statements or by using the appropriate command depending on the database system (e.g., DROP CONSTRAINT in PostgreSQL, DROP INDEX in MySQL).


### Creating multiple foreign key:

In MySQL, you can indeed create multiple foreign key constraints in the same table. This allows you to establish relationships between multiple columns within the same table and columns in other tables. Each foreign key constraint will reference a different column in another table, and they can coexist within the same table without any issue.

***Exmaple**
Let's consider a scenario where we have a Bookings table that stores information about bookings made by customers. Each booking is associated with a customer, a table number, and a waiter. We want to create foreign key constraints to ensure referential integrity.

sql


```sql
CREATE TABLE Customers (
    CustomerID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Tables (
    TableNumber INT PRIMARY KEY
);

CREATE TABLE Waiters (
    WaiterID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL
);

CREATE TABLE Bookings (
    BookingID INT PRIMARY KEY,
    CustomerID INT,
    TableNumber INT,
    WaiterID INT,
    BookingDate DATE,
    NumberOfGuests INT,
    FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers(CustomerID),
    FOREIGN KEY (TableNumber) REFERENCES Tables(TableNumber),
    FOREIGN KEY (WaiterID) REFERENCES Waiters(WaiterID)
);
```

A `SQL CHECK constraint` is used to limit the value range that can be placed in the Quantity column. This is how a Domain constraint can be specified on a table.

## Lab Instructions 

Mangata and Gallo is a jewelry store that specializes in special occasions like engagements, weddings and anniversaries. The jewelry company primarily operates online and has a small storefront in Austin, Texas with an atelier attached for browsing. The company approached you to create three tables for their database called 'Clients', 'Orders' and 'Items' respectively. Each database must have all necessary constraints applied as specified in each task.  

 
The 'Clients' table contains the Client ID, full name and phone number of each client. 
 

The Orders table contains information about each order's Order ID, Client ID, Product ID, and Cost.  
 

The Items table contains information about the Item ID, Item name, and Item price. 
 

The relationship between the three table is illustrated in the following entity relationship diagram (ER-D).

**Note:** Before you begin, make sure you know how to access [MySQL environment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/database-structures-and-management-with-mysql/supplement/BSZK6/how-to-access-mysql-environment). 

###  Prerequisites  

To complete this lab, you must have the Mangata and Gallo database in MySQL, so that you can create the three tables within it. If you do not have the database, then create it in MySQL using the following instructions.  

<br> 

The code to create and use the database is as follows:  

1: Create database 

```SQL 

CREATE DATABASE Mangata_Gallo; 

``` 

2: Use database 

```SQL 

USE Mangata_Gallo; 

``` 

 
## There is one main objective in this activity:   

* Apply commonly used types of constraints in MySQL.


## Exercise Instructions 

Please attempt the following tasks.

**Task 1:** Create the Clients table with the following constraints. 

* ClientID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY 

* FullName: VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL 

* PhoneNumber: INT, NOT NULL and UNIQUE 

 

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

**Task 2:** Create the Items table with the following attributes and constraints: 

* ItemID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY 

* ItemName: VARCHAR(100) and NOT NULL 

* Price: Decimal(5,2) and NOT NULL 

 

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)

**Task 3:** Create the Orders table with the following constraints. 

* OrderID: INT, NOT NULL and PRIMARY KEY 

* ClientID: INT, NOT NULL and FOREIGN KEY 

* ItemID: INT, NOT NULL and FOREIGN KEY 

* Quantity: INT, NOT NULL and maximum allowed items in each order 3 only 

* COST Decimal(6,2) and NOT NULL 

 

The expected structure of the table should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populated the tables correctly.)
