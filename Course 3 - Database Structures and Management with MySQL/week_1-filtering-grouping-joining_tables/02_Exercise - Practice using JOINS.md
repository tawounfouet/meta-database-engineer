# Lab Instructions
Little Lemon is a family-owned Mediterranean restaurant, focused on traditional recipes served with a modern twist. The Little Lemon database contains many tables of data including Customers and Bookings.

The Customers table contains the following data about each customer: 
- Customer ID, 
- Full name,
- and phone number.

- booking ID, 
- booking date, 
- table number, 
- number of guests,
- and the ID of the customer who made the booking.

### Prerequisites
To complete this lab, you must first have created the Little Lemon database MySQL. You must also have created the Customers and the Bookings tables and populated them with relevant data. If you have not created this database or any of the required tables, then please read the following instructions.

1. The code to create the database is as follows:
```SQL
CREATE DATABASE IF NOT EXISTS little_lemon_joins_db;


# use the database
USE little_lemon_joins_db;

CREATE TABLE Customers(CustomerID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, FullName VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL, PhoneNumber INT NOT NULL UNIQUE);


INSERT INTO Customers(CustomerID, FullName, PhoneNumber) VALUES (1, "Vanessa McCarthy", 0757536378), (2, "Marcos Romero", 0757536379), (3, "Hiroki Yamane", 0757536376), (4, "Anna Iversen", 0757536375), (5, "Diana Pinto", 0757536374);


CREATE TABLE Bookings (BookingID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,  BookingDate DATE NOT NULL,  TableNumber INT NOT NULL, NumberOfGuests INT NOT NULL CHECK (NumberOfGuests <= 8), CustomerID INT NOT NULL, FOREIGN KEY (CustomerID) REFERENCES Customers (CustomerID) ON DELETE CASCADE ON UPDATE CASCADE); 


INSERT INTO Bookings (BookingID, BookingDate, TableNumber, NumberOfGuests, CustomerID) VALUES (10, '2021-11-11', 7, 5, 1), (11, '2021-11-10', 5, 2, 2), (12, '2021-11-10', 3, 2, 4);
```


There are two main objectives of this activity:
1. Create an INNER JOIN query.

2. Create a LEFT JOIN query.

### Task Instructions
Please attempt the following tasks:

**Task**: Little Lemon want a list of all customers who have made bookings. Write an INNER JOIN SQL statement to combine the full name and the phone number of each customer from the Customers table with the related booking date and 'number of guests' from the Bookings table.

The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populate the tables correctly.)

**Solution**:
```sql
SELECT c.FullName, c.PhoneNumber, b.BookingDate, b.NumberOfGuests
FROM Customers c
INNER JOIN Bookings b
ON c.CustomerID = b.CustomerID;

# or 
SELECT Customers.FullName, Customers.PhoneNumber, Bookings.BookingDate, Bookings.NumberOfGuests 
FROM Customers INNER JOIN Bookings 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Bookings.CustomerID;
```



**Task 2**: Little Lemon want to view information about all existing customers with bookings that have been made so far. This data must include customers who havenâ€™t made any booking yet.

Write a LEFT JOIN SQL statement to view the customer id from Customers table and the related booking id from the Bookings table. The expected output result should be the same as the following screenshot (assuming that you have created and populate the tables correctly.)

**Solution**:
```sql
SELECT c.CustomerID, b.BookingID
FROM Customers c
LEFT JOIN Bookings b
ON c.CustomerID = b.CustomerID;

# or
SELECT Customers.CustomerID, Bookings.BookingID 
FROM Customers LEFT JOIN Bookings 
ON Customers.CustomerID = Bookings.CustomerID;
