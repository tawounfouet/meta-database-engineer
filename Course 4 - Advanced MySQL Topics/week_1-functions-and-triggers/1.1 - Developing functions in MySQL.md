# Developing functions in MySQL 

`UDF` : User Difined Functions :
- use-defined-code  -> Task (function) -> results
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION function_name()
RETURNS datatype DETERMINISTIC;  -- means the function always returns the same results for the same input parameter
RETURN
```
Exple
```sql
-- Creating the udf
CREATE FUNCTION FindTotalCost(Cost DECIMAL(5,2))
RETURNS DECIMAL (5, 2) DETERMINISTIC 
RETURN (Cost - (Cost * 0.1));


-- Invoking the UDF
SELECT FindTotalCost(100);
```


```sql
-- Creating the udf
DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION GetTotalCost(Cost DECIMAL(5,2)) RETURNS DECIMAL (5, 2) DETERMINISTIC  

BEGIN
IF (Cost >= 100 AND Cost < 500) THEN SET Cost = Cost - (Cost * 0.1); 
ELSEIF (Cost >= 500) THEN SET Cost = Cost - (Cost * 0.2);
END IF;
RETURN (Cost);
END //

DELIMITER;

-- DELIMITER

-- Invoking the UDF
-- Call the function with 500
SELECT GetTotalCost(500);


-- To drop the function
DROP FUNCTION GetTotalCost; 
```

## Store Procedure

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetProductSummary(OUT NumberOfLowPriceProducts INT, OUT NumberOfHighPriceProducts INT)

BEGIN
SELECT COUNT(ProductID) INTO NumberOfLowPriceProducts 
FROM Products 
WHERE Price < 50;

SELECT COUNT(ProductID) INTO NumberOfHighPriceProducts 
FROM Products 
WHERE Price >= 50;
END //
DELIMITER;

---  call the procedure
CALL GetProductSummary(@TotalNumberOfLowPriceProducts, @TotalNumberOfHighPriceProducts);
```

```sql
CREATE FUNCTION FindCost(order_id INT) 
RETURNS DECIMAL (5,2) DETERMINISTIC 
RETURN (SELECT Cost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = order_id);


SELECT FindCost(5);
```





## Lab Instructions

Lucky Shrub needs to query their database. They can do this by using functions and stored procedures in MySQL. 

In this lab, you must complete a series of tasks to help Lucky Shrub staff query data from the Orders table in their database. 

The Orders table contains information about the Order ID, Client ID, Product ID, Quantity and Cost as shown in the following screenshot.

**Note:** Before you begin, make sure you know how to access [MySQL environment](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-mysql-topics/supplement/Xp5Mg/how-to-access-mysql-environment).


##  Prerequisites  

First, create the Lucky Shrub database in your MySQL environment. Then, create and populate the Orders table with the relevant data inside the Lucky Shrub database. 

The code to create the database and the Orders table is listed below.  

1: Use the following code to create the database: 

```SQL 
CREATE DATABASE Lucky_Shrub_functions_triggers;
``` 

2: Make use of the following code to use the database:  

```SQL 
USE Lucky_Shrub_functions_triggers; 
``` 

3: Use the following code to create the Orders table:  

```SQL 
CREATE TABLE Orders (OrderID INT NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY, ClientID VARCHAR(10), ProductID VARCHAR(10), Quantity INT, Cost DECIMAL(6,2), Date DATE); 
``` 

4: Use the following code to insert the data:  

```SQL 
INSERT INTO Orders(OrderID, ClientID, ProductID , Quantity, Cost, Date) VALUES
(1, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500, "2020-09-01"),  
(2, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100, "2020-09-05"),  
(3, "Cl3", "P3", 20, 800, "2020-09-03"),  
(4, "Cl4", "P4", 15, 150, "2020-09-07"),  
(5, "Cl3", "P3", 10, 450, "2020-09-08"),  
(6, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 800, "2020-09-09"),  
(7, "Cl1", "P4", 22, 1200, "2020-09-10"),  
(8, "Cl3", "P1", 15, 150, "2020-09-10"),  
(9, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500, "2020-09-12"),  
(10, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100, "2020-09-13"),  
(11, "Cl4", "P5", 5, 100, "2020-09-15"), 
(12, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500, "2022-09-01"),  
(13, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100, "2022-09-05"),  
(14, "Cl3", "P3", 20, 800, "2022-09-03"),  
(15, "Cl4", "P4", 15, 150, "2022-09-07"),  
(16, "Cl3", "P3", 10, 450, "2022-09-08"),  
(17, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 800, "2022-09-09"),  
(18, "Cl1", "P4", 22, 1200, "2022-09-10"),  
(19, "Cl3", "P1", 15, 150, "2022-09-10"),  
(20, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500, "2022-09-12"),  
(21, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100, "2022-09-13"),   
(22, "Cl2", "P1", 10, 500, "2021-09-01"),  
(23, "Cl2", "P2", 5, 100, "2021-09-05"),  
(24, "Cl3", "P3", 20, 800, "2021-09-03"),  
(25, "Cl4", "P4", 15, 150, "2021-09-07"),  
(26, "Cl1", "P3", 10, 450, "2021-09-08"),  
(27, "Cl2", "P1", 20, 1000, "2022-09-01"),  
(28, "Cl2", "P2", 10, 200, "2022-09-05"),  
(29, "Cl3", "P3", 20, 800, "2021-09-03"),  
(30, "Cl1", "P1", 10, 500, "2022-09-01");    
```   
 

## There are two main objectives in this activity:
 
* Develop a user defined function.
* Develop a stored procedure. 

## Tasks Instructions 

Please attempt the following tasks to make it easier for Lucky Shrub staff to query data from their database. 

**Task 1:** 

Create a SQL function that prints the cost value of a specific order based on the user input of the OrderID. 

The expected output result should be the same as the result in the screenshot below when you call the function with OrderID 5.    

![Task 1 output](images/task1output.PNG) 

```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE FUNCTION GetOrderCost(Order_ID INT)
RETURNS DECIMAL(6,2)
BEGIN
    DECLARE OrderCost DECIMAL(6,2);
    SELECT Cost INTO OrderCost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = Order_ID;
    RETURN OrderCost;
END //
DELIMITER;



-- To call the function with OrderID 5, y
SELECT GetOrderCost(5) AS 'Order Cost';
```

**Task 2:** 

Create a stored procedure called "GetDiscount". This stored procedure must return the final cost of the customer’s order after the discount value has been deducted. The discount value is based on the order’s quantity. 

The stored procedure must have the following specifications: 

The procedure should take one parameter that accepts a user input value of an OrderID. 
The procedure must find the order quantity of the specific OrderID. 
If the value of the order quantity is more than or equal to "20" then the procedure should return the new cost after a 20% discount. 
If the value of the order quantity is less than "20" and more than or equal to "10" then the procedure should return the new cost after a 10% discount.

The expected output result should be the same as the result in the screenshot below when you call the procedure with OrderID 5.

![Task 2 output](images/task2output.PNG)  

You can compare and check your answers with the solutions in the Solution section.
Remember that you can achieve the same result in different ways. This is fine as long the code executes as expected.
 
```sql
DELIMITER //

CREATE PROCEDURE GetDiscount(IN Order_ID INT)
BEGIN
    DECLARE Order_Quantity INT;
    DECLARE New_Cost DECIMAL(6,2);
    
    SELECT Quantity INTO Order_Quantity FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = Order_ID;
    
    IF Order_Quantity >= 20 THEN
        SET New_Cost = (SELECT Cost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = Order_ID) * 0.8; -- 20% discount
    ELSEIF Order_Quantity >= 10 THEN
        SET New_Cost = (SELECT Cost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = Order_ID) * 0.9; -- 10% discount
    ELSE
        SET New_Cost = (SELECT Cost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = Order_ID);
    END IF;
    
    SELECT New_Cost AS 'Final Cost After Discount';
END //
DELIMITER;


-- To call the procedure with OrderID 5,
CALL GetDiscount(5);
```


```sql
DELIMITER // 

CREATE Procedure GetDiscount(OrderIDInput INT) 
     BEGIN 
         DECLARE cost_after_discount DECIMAL(7,2); 
         DECLARE current_cost DECIMAL(7,2); 
         DECLARE order_quantity INT; 
         SELECT Quantity INTO order_quantity FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = OrderIDInput; 
         SELECT Cost INTO current_cost FROM Orders WHERE OrderID = OrderIDInput; 
        IF order_quantity >= 20 THEN
          SET cost_after_discount = current_cost - (current_cost * 0.2);              
        ELSEIF order_quantity >= 10 THEN
          SET cost_after_discount = current_cost - (current_cost * 0.1); 
        ELSE SET cost_after_discount = current_cost;
        END IF;
    SELECT cost_after_disc`unt; 
END//

DELIMITER ;
